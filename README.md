# Duplicate Code Detection Tool
A simple Python3 tool to detect similarities between files within a repository.

## What?
A command line tool that receives a directory or a list of files and determines
the degree of similarity between them.

## Why?
The tool intends guide the refactoring efforts of a developer who wishes
to reduce code duplication within a component and improve its software
architecture.

Its development was initiated within the context of the
[DAT265 - Software Evolution Project](https://pingpong.chalmers.se/public/courseId/9754/lang-en/publicPage.do).

## How?
The tool uses the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) Python library to
determine the similarity between source code files, supplied by the user.
The currently supported languages are C, C++, JAVA, Python and C#.

### Dependencies
The following Python packages have to be installed:
  * nltk
    * `pip3 install --user nltk`
  * gensim
    * `pip3 install --user gensim`
  * punkt
    * `python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt`

## Get started
Suppress the warnings (generated by the used libraries)
as `python3 -W ignore duplicate_code_detection.py` and then supply the necessary
arguments. More details can be found by running the tool with the `--help` option.

**Notice:** Due to the way the models are created, the more source files you
provide the tool the more accurate the similarity calculations are. In other
words, the bigger the project, the more useful the tool is.

### Example
If `duplicate-code-detection-tool` is the name where the tool resides in and
`smartcar_shield/src` contains the repository you want to check for source code
similarities between the files, then you can run the following to get the
similarity report:

`python3 -W ignore duplicate-code-detection-tool/duplicate_code_detection.py -d smartcar_shield/src/`

The result should look something like this:
